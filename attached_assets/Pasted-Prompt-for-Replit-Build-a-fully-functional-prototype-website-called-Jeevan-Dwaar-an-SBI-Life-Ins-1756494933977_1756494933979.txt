Prompt for Replit:
"Build a fully functional prototype website called Jeevan Dwaar — an SBI Life Insurance platform to make life insurance simple, transparent, and trustworthy for low-literacy and rural/semi-urban customers in India. The website should include the following features:

1. Landing Page

Clean, mobile-first design in React + Tailwind CSS.

Short pitch: “Life Insurance Made Simple – In Your Language.”

Call-to-action buttons: “Find My Policy”, “Learn About Insurance”.

Use warm colors and friendly illustrations to feel approachable.

2. Policy Explainer Page

Voice-first summaries: 30-second audio clips (dummy MP3s) in multiple languages summarizing premium, coverage, key exclusions, and claim process.

Icon-based key facts: Replace PDFs with a single card view showing:

Shield icon → coverage amount

Calendar icon → policy duration

Crossed-circle → exclusions

Phone icon → claims helpline

“3 Things You Must Know” always displayed at top: coverage period, main exclusion, claim helpline.

3. AI Policy Recommender (Interactive Form)

Simple onboarding form: age, income, dependents, and goal (education, retirement, protection).

Output: recommended policy tiers with transparent age-band premiums (dummy JSON data):

18–30 yrs → ₹25/month

31–45 yrs → ₹50/month

46–60 yrs → ₹100/month

Flat micro-premiums for entry-level covers (₹2–₹10 range).

Pre-renewal alert demo: banner showing how premiums will change with age.

4. Education Hub

Short videos and infographics to explain:

Why premiums vary by age (use “young tree vs old tree” analogy).

Common exclusions (suicide clause, waiting periods).

Claim process in 3 steps.

Vernacular content toggle (English + 2–3 regional languages as sample).

5. Acknowledgment + Consent Demo

When users “accept policy”, show OTP or checkbox flow with stored confirmation (mock only).

Generate a downloadable/local-language PDF or slip summarizing terms (dummy text).

6. Mitra / Claim Sahayak Section

Info card explaining how trained community staff help clarify terms and assist during claims.

Optional chatbot button for user queries (mock with sample answers).

7. SBI Life Dashboard (Prototype)

Admin-only mock dashboard showing:

No. of policies recommended vs accepted

Common user questions collected from chatbot

Language preferences

Potential premium inflow projections (dummy data).

Use React + TailwindCSS for the frontend and Node.js (or Flask) backend stub with mock JSON data. Ensure code is modular, production-ready, responsive, and includes placeholders for real audio, video, and chatbot integrations. Focus on clear navigation and human-centric visuals with rounded cards and simple animations.
